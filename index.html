            My name is Eric Gabbard and I'm going to be a computer science graduate in 2023.
            I strive to develop software that challenges my skills and pushes me forward towards a career in 
            Cyber Security. I'm a Michigan native and my biggest hobbies are traveling, computer building, and self learning. I've taught myself
             guitar as well as most of my knowledge on computer components before I started undergrad. My passion for computers
            and problem solving is something I've had for as long as I can remember and I look to forward to seeing how much
            further my passion can take me.
