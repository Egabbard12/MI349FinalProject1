        <h1 class="project">Software Engineering Project</h1>
        <p>
            This was a project I built for a Software Engineering course at Michigan State University.
            I had to build a website with a prototype for a customer from Ford. The prototype displayed a 
            theoretical Traffic Jam Assist system and how we expected it to work in different scenarios. I was
            responsible for all of the code of the project and website.

        <h2 class="project">Android Develpment Team Project</h2>
        <p>
            This is an Android app I helped build as a part of a team project. It is a small game that helps you see 
            the most iconic sights on campus. We used Google Maps locations and built our own data-base with 
            sql and php. The video editing below was done by Drew Bayait a fellow cse student.

        <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I built this app as a final project for my Object Oriented Programming course. I used C++ and made a basic 
            animation tool that supports keyframes. Below is a .anim file of an animation I built using that code as 
            well as the link to the github for the code. You will need a tool to run the animation without the source
            code.
